# Clear-Sky Solar Irradiation
Calculation procedure for Clear-Sky Beam and Diffuse Solar Irradiance via following the Example 1, 3, and 4 in Chapter 14 of ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals (SI Edition). The idea here is to calculate the solar heat gain, as dependent to the time, on arbitrary surfaces (i.e. windows).
